Does OBW gain a commission from my enquiry or booking?</h3> <p>No, we are not. We are not a travel agent, nor do we get commission from your queries or bookings.</p> <p>We are storytellers for good. We tell stories of everyday people doing good to inspire others to take action and help. The stories featured in The Better Traveller are those that are travel and hospitality-related. We thought it would be a good idea to compile and share them so you can see that your travel choices and activities can help make a difference in the world you’re exploring.</p> <p>Our Better World is a digital storytelling initiative of the Singapore International Foundation.</p> <h3>So you\'re not an agent, but a storyteller. Why are you telling these stories? What exactly does Our Better World do?</h3> <p>We tell these stories to inspire people like you to consider how you can make a difference – in this case, since we are telling you travel stories – to become a better traveller. We believe that no action is too small and every action that helps others matter. We thought it would be good to showcase through our stories, how travellers like you can make choices that benefit local communities and the environment, by connecting you to our story partners (featured in our stories) who are delivering these unique travel experiences.</p> <p>At the core, Our Better World is about moving people to action through stories. You can make a difference – and we want to remind and inspire you and others that we all have the power to make the world better.</p> <h3>I know of a travel business that helps the community too, how do I tell you about it?</h3> <p>Feel free to share about it <a href="https://www.ourbetterworld.org/pitch-stories" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. </p> <h3>Will you sell my personal info?</h3> <p>No. We will use it in line with our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p> <p>If you have registered interest for any of the travel experiences by sharing your contact details, we will share them with our story partners who will be in touch with you with more details. </p> <h3>Will you be able to help me with my bookings?</h3> <p>If you have registered interest to find out more about any of the travel experiences featured in our stories by sharing your contact details, these will be passed on to our respective story partners and they will be in touch with you on details and any queries you may have on bookings.</p> <h3>What if I have other questions?</h3> <p>Feel free drop us a line at <a href="mailto:storyteller@ourbetterworld.org">storyteller@ourbetterworld.org</a> or via the form at <a href="https://www.ourbetterworld.org/en/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://www.ourbetterworld.org/en/contact-us</a>.
