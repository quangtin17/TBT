          '<h3>In his words:</h3> <p> “Every day, I cycle to work from Pondok Upeh, a kampung about 5km away, where I live with my atok (grandfather). He is happy that I have a regular job, because it was hard for me to hold a job down previously. </p> <p> I joined Stepping Stone in August 2003. I was given the chance to try out three departments – cooking, weaving and crafts – and I chose cooking. </p> <p> The staff knew that I was interested in cooking, so one day they took me to St Nicholas Home, an institution serving the visually disabled, as it offered bakery courses. After finishing my course, I tried looking for a job, but didn’t manage to hold them for long. Finally in 2009, I rejoined Stepping Stone and became a member of the bakery department. </p> <p> Our head Aina saw that I was really keen on baking, so she recruited an experienced baker to help us. Under Calvin’s supervision, my skills improved. Our menu has expanded tremendously and we even get regular orders from outsiders now. Sometimes we even come up with our own innovations. We think, what would people at kopitiams like to dunk their coffee with? That’s how we created the mini- benggali roti three years ago. </p> <figure> <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/919/320/218" alt="" /> </figure> <p> The members at Stepping Stone are very encouraging and supportive. I used to be very short tempered when people don’t understand me, but the staff advised me not to get angry. Like the other day at the mosque, there was a guy who tried to be difficult and said OKU [people with disabilities] are not supposed to follow the azan [ Muslim call to prayers]. Do I feel hurt? Yes, of course. But I didn’t argue and just answered him politely. Like my colleagues say, there is no use getting upset. Just do our best and don’t think so much. </p> <p> At some point, I want to graduate from Stepping Stone] and work outside. Everyone has dreams. I’d like to buy a house someday. I have a girlfriend – she is from the weaving section. It’s better to look for people who are the same because we understand each other better. Her family isn’t keen on the idea of us marrying. Maybe they are worried that I cannot take care of her because I am an OKU. But no problem. I have come further than I ever thought I would. I have faith that together, we will find a way to achieve our dreams. </p> <p> Read more about <b> <a href="#" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Weekend of Good in Malaysia </a> </b> or <b> <a href="#" style="text-decoration: underline;">Malaysia Journey</a> </b> <br /> Find out more about <b> <a href="#" style="text-decoration: underline;" >Experience in Malaysia</a > </b> </p>'
